      <Content>&lt;P&gt;Late yesterday&amp;nbsp;evening &lt;A href="http://www.pixelplastic.de/blog/"&gt;Marci&lt;/A&gt; came back from Thailand. &lt;A href="http://krissi.dyndns.org/"&gt;Krissi&lt;/A&gt;, Robert and me picked him up at the train station for a warm welcome. We drove home, dropping off Krissi at her place, and&amp;nbsp;Susi was already waiting at the hallway. Although she came way too late to meet us at the station, she luckily had to wait just about 15 minutes. Marci had a lot to tell us about Myanmar, Thailand, the pedestrians of Bangkok and also showed us the nice disease he got for our enjoyment. Pretty neat bottom, man! Unfortunately he had to clink glasses with water because &lt;A href="http://www.drweil.com/u/QA/QA326593/"&gt;alcohol may delay his recovery&lt;/A&gt;. Nevertheless, there are other ways to eat bread and butter with great relish...&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I am happy that again somebody else besides me and &lt;A href="http://www.pixelplastic.de/images/20041221%20-%20Fotosession%20mit%20Schneeball/medium/IMG_2649.jpg"&gt;Snowball&lt;/A&gt; is present in the apartment! Silke and Gesa are returning in mid-October, then we'll be complete again.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There will be a "Kartoffelsuppe" welcome "banquet" sometime the next days, you're welcome to join us!&lt;/P&gt;
