      <Content>&lt;P&gt;Today I had an interview at &lt;A href="http://www.saxsys.de/"&gt;Saxonia Systems&lt;/A&gt; in Dresden. I've sent them my resume to let them check the possibility of me writing my master thesis there.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The interview was nice and fluent and I was happy to gain a little insight to the company, the corporate philisophy and their projects. I especially&amp;nbsp;appreciate the way they're trying to develop the employees' skills&amp;nbsp;in meetings and reviews.&amp;nbsp;I hope they like the work I did until now, too. In about two weeks I'll be notified if I have the chance of joining the company and the topic they suggest writing on.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;On the way to Dresden I gave a girl and a boy from Rostock &lt;A href="http://www.mitfahrgelegenheit.de/"&gt;a lift&lt;/A&gt;, so the journey time was pretty entertaining. When I got back to Leipzig I drove by Susi and Steffi but I was told that they're on vacation with their mum. Maybe next time.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What an interesting day. Tonight I'll join &lt;A href="http://www.boldhaus.info"&gt;Gunnar&lt;/A&gt; to have some draught together. :-)&lt;/P&gt;</Content>
